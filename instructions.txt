In this experiment you'll listen to an audiobook in short excerpts and answer comprehension questions after some of the excerpts. During some segments the speech will sound natural. Other segments will be sped up or slowed down. Finally, the cadence on some segments will be more random or more regular than natural speech. On each trial, do your best to listen and follow the story.
