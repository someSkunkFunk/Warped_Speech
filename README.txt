imported from Aaron's box folder on 7-18-2024
seems trial conditions were included as "m" variable in s1_data (output of s01_WarpedSpeech.mat)
although not sure what the cadence condition means
aaron sent me another copy of s01_WarpedSpeech.mat which i renamed to s01_WarpedSpeech2.mat but they seem identical

original folder on Box only had stimuli and data folders, I added a bunch of extra stuff (that maybe I should contain within a "Warped Speech/andre" folder)
